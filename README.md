I solved more than 90 problems and finished a small project, which helped me discover how much I enjoy solving problems. Working on these challenges taught me to think carefully and improve my coding skills. It also showed me how fun and satisfying it can be to find solutions through programming.

This experience made me realize that I love coding and problems-solving. The small project I completed was especially exciting because it allowed me to see how programming can be used to create useful solutions. It made me even more interested in learning more about programming and turning it into a career.

Now, I want to study programming at university to grow my skills and knowledge. I believe university will help me learn more about this field and prepare me for a career in technology. Iâ€™m excited to keep solving problems, learning new things, and building a future in programming.
